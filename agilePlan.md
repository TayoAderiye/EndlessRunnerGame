# Agile Plan for Endless Runner Game Development

## Project Overview:
- **Project Name:** Endless Runner Game
- **Description:** Create an endless runner game where the player controls a character that automatically moves forward, avoiding obstacles by jumping, and collecting coins to increase the score. The game will feature procedurally generated levels with increasing difficulty.

## Key Features:
1. **Character Control:**
   - Implement basic character movement mechanics.
   - Character automatically moves forward.
   - Allow the player to jump to avoid obstacles.
2. **Obstacle Generation:**
   - Generate obstacles procedurally with increasing difficulty.
   - Ensure obstacles are appropriately spaced and challenging.
3. **Coin Collection:**
   - Place coins throughout the level for the player to collect.
   - Increase player score upon collecting coins.
4. **Score Tracking:**
   - Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's progress.
   - Display the score prominently on the screen.
5. **UI/UX Design:**
   - Design user-friendly menus and interfaces.
   - Include buttons for starting the game, viewing high scores, and accessing settings.
6. **Sound Effects and Music:**
   - Add sound effects for jumping, collecting coins, and colliding with obstacles.
   - Include background music to enhance the gaming experience.

## Sprint Planning:
- **Sprint 1 (1 week):**
  - Set up the project environment in Godot Engine.
  - Implement basic character movement and jumping mechanics.
  - Begin obstacle generation system.
- **Sprint 2 (1 week):**
  - Complete obstacle generation system with increasing difficulty.
  - Implement coin collection mechanics.
  - Integrate basic scoring system.
- **Sprint 3 (1 week):**
  - Refine character movement and jumping mechanics based on playtesting feedback.
  - Polish obstacle generation to ensure balanced gameplay.
  - Enhance UI/UX design with menus and buttons.
- **Sprint 4 (1 week):**
  - Add sound effects for character actions, coin collection, and obstacle collisions.
  - Integrate background music into the game.
  - Perform thorough testing and bug fixing.
- **Sprint 5 (1 week):**
  - Finalize UI/UX design elements.
  - Implement high score tracking functionality.
  - Prepare for release by optimizing performance and finalizing documentation.

## Review and Retrospective:
- **Review:** At the end of each sprint, conduct a review meeting to demonstrate the completed features and gather feedback from stakeholders.
- **Retrospective:** Followed by a retrospective meeting to reflect on what went well, what could be improved, and any adjustments needed for future sprints.
